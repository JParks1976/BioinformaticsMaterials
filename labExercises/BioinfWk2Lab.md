#Bioinformatics Week 2 Lab
##Unix and command line interface

Slides for the introduction to today's lab, as well as a PDF of this document, can be found on [Blackboard](http://blackboard.uttyler.edu).

###Learning Objectives
You should be able to:

1. Understand why and how to view text files in a text editor (i.e., Notepad++) as opposed to a word processing program (i.e., Microsoft Word).
2. Apply basic unix shell scripting commands to navigate and manipulate files in the command line.

###Readings:
* PCB: Chapter 1 (Getting set up)
* PCB: Chapter 4 (Command-line operations: the shell)

###Activities

This introduction to the Unix shell will show you some powerful tools for working with files in the command line. This is not a comprehensive introduction, but you will learn some of the most common commands using Cygwin, a shell emulator for Windows, which is already installed on the lab computers.

**Navigation and file management**

pwd

ls

mkdir

cd

cp

mv

rmdir

**Working within files**

nano

cat

head

more

tail

wc

cut

sort

uniq

**Finding things**

find

grep

**Reminders about the Unix shell**
* Avoid spaces in file names
* Everything is case sensitive
* Paths are important!
* Shortcut: Use tab to complete unique paths
* Shortcut: arrow up to repeat or modify the last command 
* Use `-h` after a command to read the help page
